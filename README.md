# A 3 Mode Assembly Program 

A user is able to choose between 3 modes; Variable PWM, Strobing Display and LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register). Each mode is configurable with pre-set values to change the speed or functionality of the mode.

- Variable PWM produces visual modulating square wave at variable frequncies and duty cycles.

- Strobing Display outputs a linear output to the LEDs at various speeds and patterns.

- LFSR is a random sequence generator which uses its previous input to create its next sequence.

Main code found in 'PROGRAM.asm'

**Getting Started**
- This work was undertaken during my time at university and unfortunately I dont have access to the files needed to setup the MPLAB X simulation enviroment.
- If someone wants to give this a go, then this was programmed using MPLAB X V5.35 and written for the PIC16F.
