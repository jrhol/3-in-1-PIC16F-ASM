User is able to choose between 3 modes; Variable PWM, Strobing Display and LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register). Each mode is configurable with pre-set values to change the speed or functionality of the mode.

• Variable PWM produces visual modulating square wave at variable frequncies and duty cycles.

• Strobing Display outputs a linear output to the LEDs at various speeds and patterns.

• LFSR is a random sequence generator which uses its previous input to create its next sequence.
